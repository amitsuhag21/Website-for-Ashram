                    <h1>Introduction Of Oshodhara</h1>
                    <p>
                        Oshodahara is an existential, live Mystic school formed by an Enlightened Master Sadguru Osho Siddharth Aulia.It is known as a Mystic school as it compiles the teachings of various Mystics, Sages and Enlightened Masters in a scientific manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oshodhara is of the seekers, for the seekers and by the seekers, who are interested in self-transformation through meditation, samadhi and devotion and ultimately leading to enlightenment .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oshodhara is the only live spiritual stream of <b>Osho</b>, the greatest spiritual master of the 20th century and also known as the <b>Master of Masters</b>. It is the only <b>“live” spiritual stream</b> as the Master disciple (Guru Shishya) tradition is it’s very foundation and it is spiritual because all the activities are aimed at inner growth of the seekers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Spiritualism is a science of experience. Realization and experience of self and existence/godliness is the base of spiritual journey in Oshodhara ,not the rituals or mere bookish knowledge. Hence all the programs in Oshodhara are designed in a scientific manner to experience the God/Godliness subjectively. As Osho says – <b>Don’t believe in belief, believe in your own experience.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oshodhara guides a seeker to become <b>“Zorba the Buddha”</b> -. This term was coined by Osho who encouraged people to embrace the godliness of Buddha , without neglecting the worldliness of Zorba, the greek . In simple words, Zorba the Buddha means an individual who is contented both materialistically and spiritually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oshodhara has been developed as a <b>life affirmative stream</b> wherein seekers are taught how to best fulfil their responsibilities in the world, staying true to their inner self, remaining grounded and centered in their own self. <b>The programs deeply integrate the concept of Satyam Shivam Sundaram in the lives of seekers.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today there's a huge misconception rampant in the world when it comes to meditation. Meditation is falsely understood as either mindfulness, chanting mantras or concentration on a particular object. Oshodhara not only teaches the right way to meditate, but it has developed such scientific, precise and simple meditation techniques that everyone can do them. They can be learnt at the programs and can be practised easily at home later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <b>‘Unless Mediation becomes Enlightenment, you have simply wasted your time.’ – Osho</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Having converted spirituality into a science, Oshodhara is based on 4 pillars namely </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>1. Meditation ,2. Sakshi ( Witness)  3. Samadhi ( Just Awareness)   4. Sumiran (divine remembrance)</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the above pillars of spirituality can be practically experienced in the programs conducted at Oshodhara. Oshodhara is a beautiful confluence of Gyan Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Karm Yoga. Sages have called this conjunction as Sahaj Yoga.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There are a total of <b>28 levels of Samadhi and Sumiran Programs</b>. The samadhi programs of Oshodhara makes way to Gyan Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karm Yoga and finally the sumiran programs offers the path of Sahaj Yoga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to Samadhi Programs ,there are other programs designed for the overall development of a seeker and which facilitate the spiritual growth of a seeker.There are 21 different types of wisdom/Pragya programs such as self-hypnosis ( journey from visualisation to actualization) , Past life regression, and various, Health management Programs, Programs for Married Couples, Children & Youth ,etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Till date, thousands of people have joined Oshodhara, walked on the spiritual path under the guidance of our Master and have not only attained enlightenment, but have embarked on a journey beyond enlightenment.
